-- it's defined as:

-- VS       sum (map (\x -> x * 2) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

-- $ basically says: "do first what's after me"

-- another symbol you could see sometimes it's the '@'
-- it's for DESTRUCTURING in pattern matching
-- it lets us keep the reference to the whole list,
-- the head, and the rest. You can also use it with 'structs'

-- WHERE vs LET:
-- 'where' is just syntactic construct,
-- 'let' are expressions themselves
-- so you can write:
-- let square x = x * x in (square 5, square 3, square 2)]

-- IFs - not much to say
-- they are expression, too
ifExample x = [1, if x > 2 then 999 else 0]

-- CASE
-- pattern matching on parameters in function definitions
-- is just syntactic sugar for pattern matching.
-- again, they are expressions so we can combine them with
-- other stuff.

{-- COUPLE OF WORDS OF ADVICE from "Real World Haskell"
Without some direction, there is an element of mystery to using seq effectively. Here are some useful rules for using it well.
To have any effect, a seq expression must be the first thing evaluated in an expression.

-- incorrect: seq is hidden by the application of someFunc
-- since someFunc will be evaluated first, seq may occur too late
hiddenInside x y = someFunc (x â€˜seqâ€˜ y)

-- incorrect: a variation of the above mistake
hiddenByLet x y z = let a = x â€˜seqâ€˜ someFunc y
                    in anotherFunc a z
-- correct: seq will be evaluated first, forcing evaluation of x
onTheOutside x y = x â€˜seqâ€˜ someFunc y
To strictly evaluate several values, chain applications of seq together.
