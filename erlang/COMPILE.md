# Compiling Erlang

To compile an Erlang program, you need to:

1. Open the terminal
2. Run `erl`
3. Compile `c(<module name>).` with (or without) the `.erl` extension. You can use `pwd().` to check the current directory or use `cd(<Dir>).` to change it.
4. Run the methods you export from the module with `<module name>:<method name>(<params>).`
