# Principles of Programming Languages: Exercises (A.Y. 2023/24)
## Racket

You can download [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org/) to run the code in the examples yourself!

A primer on Racket (the slides you've briefly seen during the exercises) are [here](slides/Racket-intro.pdf).

Don't forget to check the 'extras' files for additional examples or stuff I might have forgot to mention in last class. Don't worry, we'll get back on those topics the next time.

## Haskell

You can [download](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) the Haskell compile (GHC) with GHCup to test the examples by yourself!

If you want, you can setup the language server for your favorite code editor to get autocompletion and type suggestions.

Look at [COMPILE.md](haskell/COMPILE.md) for details on how to run Haskell examples.

## Erlang

You can [download](https://www.erlang.org/downloads) Erlang to run the examples yourself!

Look at [COMPILE.md](erlang/COMPILE.md) for details on how to run Erlang examples.

## Calendar
Exercise sessions won't have a regular scheduling. Here you can find a log of what we did, and when.
